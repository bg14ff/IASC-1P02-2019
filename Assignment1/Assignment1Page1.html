<h4><em> What is Lorem Ipsum?</em></h4>

									<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
										industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy
										text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of
										type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived
										not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
										remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the
										release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more
										recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
										versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>


									<p> It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the
										readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using
										Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters,
										as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable
										English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem
										Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover
										many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the
										years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
