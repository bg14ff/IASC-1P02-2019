<h2>Fun facts about white tigers</h2>

<div class="Italic">
				<p> I Am A Beautiful White Tiger Baby.
					"A white tiger is a Bengal tiger – it is not a species
					or sub-species of tiger as some people think. Like all Bengal tigers
					they used to live in the wild in Asia, particularly in countries like India.
					Now though, they live in captivity, which helps keep them protected."  </p>
</div>

	<div class="redpara">

	<p> "White tigers can weigh up to around 570 pounds,
	which is a little more than the weight of two giant pandas.
	They can grow to be more than ten feet long. They like living
	in forests and grassy areas, and their stripes help give them
	some camouflage! White tigers are white due to their genes,
	or their genetics."</p>
</div>

<div class="size">

	<p>"A white tiger also has very intriguing eyes –they are
		sapphire blue which combined with their white coat,makes
		them look very attractive and fascinating. The fur on their
		face is white, meaning you can easily tell them apart from
		other Bengal tigers.They can run quite fast – around 60 miles per hour. Can you run that fast?"</p>
