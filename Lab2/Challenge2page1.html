<h3>The standard Lorem Ipsum passage, used since the 1500s</h3>

<p>"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor
incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud
exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute
irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla
pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia
 deserunt mollit anim id est laborum."</p>

<h4>1914 translation by H. Rackham</h4>

<p>"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and
praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and
expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder
of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it
is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally
encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who
loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but
because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him
some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes
laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has
any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no
annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"</p>
